Geographic Integration Methods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
1990 Block Data Standardized to 2010 Geography:

    NHGIS standardizes the 1990 data in these time series tables to 2010 census
    geography in two steps, first allocating census counts from 1990 census
    blocks to 2010 census blocks and then summing the reallocated 1990 counts
    for all 2010 blocks that lie within each target 2010 unit. In cases where a
    1990 block may intersect multiple 2010 units, NHGIS applies interpolation to
    estimate how 1990 block characteristics are distributed among the
    intersecting 2010 blocks, primarily using the population and housing
    densities of 2000 and 2010 blocks to model the distribution of 1990
    characteristics within 1990 blocks.
    
    For details on the interpolation model, see:
    https://www.nhgis.org/documentation/time-series/1990-blocks-to-2010-geog

2000 Block Data Standardized to 2010 Geography:

    NHGIS standardizes the 2000 data in these time series tables to 2010 census
    geography in two steps, first allocating census counts from 2000 census
    blocks to 2010 census blocks and then summing the reallocated 2000 counts
    for all 2010 blocks that lie within each target 2010 unit. Where a 2000
    block intersects multiple 2010 blocks, NHGIS applies areal interpolation to
    estimate how the 2000 block characteristics are distributed among the
    intersecting 2010 blocks.
    
    In addition to the 2000 block data drawn from 2000 Census Summary File 1
    (NHGIS dataset 2000_SF1b), NHGIS uses information from three ancillary
    sources to refine the interpolation model:
    
    * 2010 census block population and housing unit counts from 2010 Census
    Summary File 1 (NHGIS dataset 2010_SF1a)
    
    * Locations of residential roads from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010
    TIGER/Line Shapefiles
    
    * Extents of developed land, which we define as 30-meter square cells in the
    2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001) (2011 Edition) with at least
    5% of their area covered by impervious surface.
    
    For details on the interpolation model, see:
    https://www.nhgis.org/documentation/time-series/2000-blocks-to-2010-geog

2010 Standardized Data:

    For time series tables that are standardized to 2010 census geography, NHGIS
    draws the 2010 data directly from 2010 Census Summary Files without any
    estimation. The only adjustment NHGIS may make to the 2010 source data is,
    for some time series, to sum source counts together to compute larger
    subtotals.

2020 Block Data Standardized to 2010 Geography:

    NHGIS standardizes the 2020 data to 2010 census geography in two steps,
    first allocating census counts from 2020 census blocks to 2010 census blocks
    and then summing the reallocated 2020 counts for all 2010 blocks that lie
    within each target 2010 unit. Where a 2020 block intersects multiple 2010
    units, NHGIS uses the population and housing densities of 2010 blocks to
    model the distribution of 2020 characteristics within 2020 blocks.

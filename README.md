# Dearing and Blevins (2024) Replication Files

Dynamic Discrete Games.

## Overview

This repository contains the replication code for all Monte Carlo experiments
and the Application of the Dearing and Blevins (2024) paper.  The replication
files for each of these are contained in separate subdirectories:

- `mc-am2007` - Replication code for the Monte Carlo experiments in Section 4.
  These simulations are based on the dynamic game of entry and exit from
  Example 1 of the paper, parameterized to match a model with five
  heterogeneous firms from Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007).

- `application` - Replication code and data for the application to U.S.
  wholesale club store competition from Section 5 of the paper.

- `mc-psd2008` - Replication code for the Monte Carlo experiments based on
  the model of Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2008), a dynamic game with
  multiple equilibria. These are reported in Appendix B.1. of the paper.

- `mc-psd2010` - Replication code for the Monte Carlo experiments based on
  the model of Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2010), a static game with
  an NPL-unstable equilibrium. These are reported in Appendix B.2. of the
  paper.

The final circulated working copy of the paper is also included as `epl.pdf`.

Each subdirectory contains a separate `README.md` file with details on
the data and/or code provided.
